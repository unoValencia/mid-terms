and a dark mode. On the bottom of the website you can see icons which are facebook, twitter and instagram; all buttons are linked to my personal acounts. The nav bar has 4 selections them being HOME, PHOTO GALLERY, SERVICES, and HISTORY. In the Home page it has some personal details about myself and facts about me. Next to that is my photo gallery which has pictures of me and some that i have taken. In services it has the programming laguages that I have knowledge in. While in History it has my background and some more details about myself. My photo gallery, services, and history all have bootstrap incorporated in them.
